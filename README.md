# mebm

mebm is a browser based video editor that supports animation of images and text overlays.
The animation is done with key-frames (denoted in blue on the timeline) and linear interpolation.

The design values simplicity and rudimentary functionality over a full feature set.
Audio is not yet supported, but is planned.
